## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, passionate about building accessible, inclusive, and intelligent technologies. As a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech and a UCARE-funded researcher, I focus on creating AI tools that bridge gaps in education—especially for neurodiverse learners.

Outside of class and research, I love building practical tools—from AI-powered summarizers to developer-focused productivity extensions—and exploring how tech can solve real-world challenges.
